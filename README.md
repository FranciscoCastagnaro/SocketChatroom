# ðŸ’¬ Socket Chatroom

This is a simple **console chatroom** which uses **TCP sockets** to manage real-time user connections.

## Motivation

This was a project to improve my understanding of networking common protocols as TCP and UDP, I found this communication concepts fascinating. Multi-threading was also implemented
in order to manage various user connections simultaneously.
